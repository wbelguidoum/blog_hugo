This blog, **`brokenbackend.blog`**, is built on a single premise: **We learn to fix vulnerabilities by first understanding how they break.** 

I believe the most effective way to master backend development and security is through shared experiences and hands-on practice. We learn through **Storytelling**, and I try to turn complex concepts into memorable **narrative case studies** (like *"The FamShare Story"*).

Every vulnerability, fix, and best practice is backed by **real, runnable code** in Go, making you an active participant.
My ultimate pursuit is to teach the best practices necessary for building backend systems that are both **reliable and secure**.
